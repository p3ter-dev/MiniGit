**Project Overview**
   
MiniGit is a lightweight, local-only version control system meticulously crafted from scratch in C++. This project serves as a foundational exploration into the core mechanics of modern version control, simulating essential Git functionalities such as repository initialization, staging changes, committing snapshots, viewing history, creating branches, switching contexts, calculating differences between commits, and performing basic merges.

It demonstrates a practical application of fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) principles, including hashing for content-addressing, efficient file I/O, graph traversal for commit history, and basic conflict resolution, all orchestrated through a Command-Line Interface (CLI).
